# Skip the BS


**Skip the BS** is a [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en) extension that removes certain elements from pages and websites with cooking recipes.

Many of these websites have a blog-like section before listing ingredients and steps to follow a recipe. Some readers might not want to see that. This extension will remove that content and instead only keep (roughly) one image, the ingredients, steps to follow the recipe, and nutritional facts.

This was done as a small project after I got annoyed of scrolling down every time I tried to follow a new cocktail recipe. A lot of design choices were made with heavy influence of [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en). I liked their user interaction, as well as issue reporting, and will plan to follow that model throughout development.
